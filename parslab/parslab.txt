JBNU Pattern Recognition and Synthesis Laboratory (PARS Lab.) conducts research on identifying meaningful patterns from various image and video data, and synthesizing new data based on the recognized patterns. Our work focuses on understanding human-related information such as pose estimation, action recognition, and situational analysis. In addition, we generate realistic images and videos conditioned on diverse modalities to advance human-centric synthesis technologies such as fasion model synthesis and Virtual Try-on (VTON).
